(** File organization

All intermediate and final results are saved in xml/json files with fixed
names derived from the names of the c files and c functions. The functions in
this file parse the xml/json files and return the top functional xml element
of these files (xml) or the dictionary (json). The filenames themselves can
be retrieved as well.

File-naming schema:

A file x.c in a project is identified by three components:
- a project path <pp>, which can be either the directory of the file
    (in case of a single file) or the location of the Makefile (in
    case of a multi file project);
- a project name <pn>, which is the x in the case of a single c file,
    and is user-specified name otherwise;
- a file path <fp>, which is the path of the directory in which the
    file resides relative to the project path. In case of a single
    c file fp is omitted.
- the file name <x> (without extension)

The user can specify a different directory to store the analysis artifacts,
which is designated by <tp> (targetpath).

Given a file x.c with project path pp, project name pn, and file path fp,
and specified target path tp, the following artifacts are produced in
multiple stages:

1. A new analysis directory is created: tp/pn.cch with two subdirectories:
   tp/pn.cch/a and tp/pn.cch/s

2. x.c is preprocessed with the gcc preprocessor, producing the file
   pp/fp/x.i. Both pp/fp/x.c and pp/fp/x.i are copied to tp/pn.cch/s/fp.

3. x.c is parsed by the CodeHawk/CIL parser, producing the following files
   tp/pn.cch/a/fp/x/x_cdict.xml
                   /x_cfile.xml
                   /functions/<x_fn>/x_fn_cfun.xml  (for every function fn in x)

3a. In case of multiple c files, the files are linked, resolving dependencies
    between globally visible functions, variables, and data structures,
    producing the files:
    tp/pn.cch/a/fp/x/x_gxrefs
                globaldefinitions.xml
                target_files.xml

4. When all c files in the project (that is, indicated by the Makefile)
   have been parsed the directory tp/pn.cch is saved as a gzipped tar file,
   tp/pn.cch.tar.gz, to enable redoing the analysis without having to
   reparse, or sharing the same parsing results with others (this is
   because the preprocessing is performed against the local environment,
   including header files, availability of other libraries, etc., and
   thus may be different for different computers).

5. Primary proof obligations are generated for x.c, producing the following
   files:
   tp/pn.cch/a/fp/x/x_cgl.xml
                    x_ctxt.xml
                    x_ixf.xml
                    x_prd.xml
                    functions/<x_fn>/x_fn_api.xml
                                    /x_fn_pod.xml
                                    /x_fn_ppo.xml
                    logfiles/x_primary.chlog
                             x_primary.errorlog
                             x_primary.infolog

6. Invariants are generated and proof obligations are checked, producing
   the following files:
   tp/pn.cch/a/fp/x/functions/<x_fn>/x_fn_invs.xml
                                    /x_fn_vars.xml
                   /logfiles/x_gencheck.chlog
                             x_gencheck.errorlog
                             x_gencheck.infolog

7. Supporting proof obligations are generated for dependencies across
   functions and files, producing
   tp/pn.cch/a/fp/x/functions/<x_fn>/x_fn_spo.xml

Steps 6 and 7 are repeated until convergence.
