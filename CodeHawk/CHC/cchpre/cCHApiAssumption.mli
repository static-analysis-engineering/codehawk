(** [mk_api_assumption ~isfile ~isglobal ~ppos ~spos id] creates an api assumption
    assumption for the predicate with index [id], the assumption id, with
    dependent primary proof obligations [ppos] and supporting proof obligations
    [spos] with file level scope if [file] is true, and including one or more
    global variables if [global] is true.

    An assumption with file level scope is not propagated to call sites.
