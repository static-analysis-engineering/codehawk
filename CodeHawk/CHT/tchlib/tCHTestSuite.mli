(** Provides a framework for creating and running tests.
    
    There are two types of tests:
    - {i assertion-based} tests, similar to JUnit tests; these are basic unit
    tests with explicit input values and checks on the output values. Output
    is provided in text format (printed to console) and xml format, compatible
    with JUnit.
    - {i generator-based} tests; these are unit tests based on random values,
    generated based on input specifications, and checked against an input-output
    (precondition, postcondition) specification.
    
    The framework has been adapted from Kaputt (https://kaputt.x9c.fr/index.html).

(** [new_testfile name date] sets up a new test file with the given name and
    date to collect the results of all test suites in the file.*)
val new_testfile: string -> string -> unit


(** [new_testsuite name date] sets up a new test suite with the given name and
    date and an empty set of tests *)
val new_testsuite: string -> string -> unit


(** [add_simple_test ~title:t f] adds a test with name [t] to the test suite that
    will perform the function [f]. Names of tests are required to be unique. 
    If the name is omitted the default name [test <x>] will be created with 
    sequence number x. *)
val add_simple_test: ?title:string -> (unit -> unit) -> unit


(** [make_random_test ~title:t ~nb_runs:nb ~nb_tries:nt ~classifier:c 
    ~reducer:red ~random_src:rnd gen f spec] constructs a random test and adds
    it to the testsuite.
    [f] is the function to be tested; when run the framework will generate [nb] 
    input values for [f] satisfying [spec] using [gen] (an input value 
    satisifies [spec] if it makes one of the preconditions evaluate to [true]).
    As it is possible to find no such input value, [nt] defines the maximum number 
    of tries when generating a value.
    
    The function[f] is then fed with those values, and the output is passed to
    the associated postcondition to check if it evaluates to [true] (otherwise,
    a counterexample has been found). The reducer is used to try to produce a
    smaller counterexample. The classifier [c] is used to group generated
    elements into categories to have a better understanding of what the random
    elements actually tested.
    
    The default values are:
    - an auto-generated ["untitled no X"] string
    ("X" being the value of a counter) for [title];
    - [100] for [nb_runs]
    - [10 * nb_runs] for [nb_tries];
    - [default_classifier] for [classifier];
    - [default-reducer] for [reducer];
    - [TCHGenerator.make_random ()] for [random_src].
    
    Raises [Invalid_arg] if either [nb] or [nt] is not strictly positive *)
