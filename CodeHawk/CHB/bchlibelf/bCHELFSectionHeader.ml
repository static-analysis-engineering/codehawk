	 SHT_NULL                0  section header is inactive; it does not have
	                            an associated section
	 SHT_PROGBITS            1  section holds information defined by the 
                                    program, whose format and meaning are
                                    determined solely by the program
         SHT_SYMTAB              2  section holds a symbol table. An object file
                                    may have only one section of each type.
                                    Typically, SHT_SYMTAB provides symbols for
                                    link editing, though it may also be used for
                                    dynamic linking. 
         SHT_STRTAB              3  section holds a string table. An object file
                                    may have multiple string tables
         SHT_RELA                4  section holds relocation entries with explicit
                                    addends, such as type Elf32_Rela for the 32-bit
                                    class of object files. An object file may have
                                    multiple relation sections
         SHT_HASH                5  section holds a symbol has table. Currently, an
                                    object file may have only one hash table.
         SHT_DYNAMIC             6  section holds information for dynamic linking. 
                                    Currently, an object file may have only one
                                    dynamic section.
         SHT_NOTE                7  section holds information that marks the file
                                    in some way.
         SHT_NOBITS              8  section of this type occupies no space in the
                                    file but otherwise resembles SHT_PROGBITS.
                                    Although this section contains no bytes, the
                                    sh_offset member contains the conceptual file
                                    offset
         SHT_REL                 9  section holds relocation entries without explicit
                                    addends. An object file may have multiple 
                                    relocation sections
         SHT_SHLIB              10  section type is reserved but has unspecified
                                    semantics

         SHT_INIT_ARRAY         14  section contains an array of pointers to 
                                    initialization functions. Each pointer in the
                                    array is taken as a parameterless procedure 
                                    with a void return
         SHT_FINI_ARRAY         15  section contains an array of pointers to
                                    termination function. Each pointer in the array
	                            is taken as a parameterless procedures with
                                    a void return
         SHT_PREINIT_ARRAY      16  section contains an array of pointers to 
                                    functions that are invoked before all other
                                    initialization function. Each pointer is taken
                                    as a parameterless procedure with a void return.
         SHT_GROUP              17  section defines a section group. A section group
                                    is a set of sections that are related and that
                                    must be treated specially by the linker. 
                                    Sections of this type may appear only in relocatable
                                    objects (objects with the ELF header e_type
                                    member set to ET_REL). The section header table
                                    entry for a group section must appear in the
                                    section header table before the entries for any
                                    of the sections that are members of the group.
         SHT_SYMTAB_SHNDX       18  section is associated with a section of type
                                    SHT_SYMTAB and is required if any of the section
                                    header indexes referenced by that symbol table
                                    contain the escape value SHN_XINDEX. The section
                                    is an array of Elf32_Word values. Each value
                                    corresponds one to one with a symbol table entry
                                    and appear in the same order as those entries.
                                    The values represent the section header indexes
                                    against which the symbol table entries are
                                    defined. Only if corresponding symbol table entry's
                                    st_shndx field contains the escape value
                                    SHN_XINDEX will the matching Elf32_Word hold the
                                    actual section header index; otherwise, the entry
                                    must be SHN_UNDEF (0)

         SHF_MERGE            0x10  the data in the setion may be merged to eliminate
                                    duplication. Unless the SHF_STRINGS flag is also
                                    set, the data elements in the section are of a 
                                    uniform size. The size of each element is specified
                                    in the section header's sh_entsize field. If the
                                    SHF_STRINGS flag is also set, the data elements
                                    consist of null-terminated character strings.
                                    The size of each character is specified in the
                                    section header's sh_entsize field.
            
                                    Each element in the section is compared against
                                    other elements in sections with the same name,
                                    type and flags. Elements that would have identical
                                    values at program run-time may be merged. Relocations
                                    referencing elements of such sections must be 
                                    resolved to the merged locations of the referenced
                                    values. Note that any relocatable values, including
                                    values that would result in run-time relocations,
                                    must be analyzed to determine whether the run-time
                                    values would actually be identical. An ABI-conforming
                                    object file may not depend on specific elements
                                    being merged, and an ABI-conforming link editor 
                                    may choose not to merge specific elements.
           SHF_STRINGS        0x20  the data elements in the section consist of
                                    null-terminated character strings. The size of 
                                    each character is specified in the section header's

           SHF_LINK_ORDER     0x80  this flag adds special ordering requirements for
                                    link editors. The requirements apply if the
                                    sh_link field of this section's header references
                                    another section (the linked-to section). If this
                                    section is combined with other sections in the
                                    output file, it must appear in the same relative
                                    order with respect to those sections, as the
                                    linked-to section appears with respect to sections
                                    the linked-to section is combined with.
           SHF_OS_NONCONFORMING 0x100 the section requires special OS-specific processing
                                    to avoid incorrect behavior. If this section has
                                    either an sh_type value or contains sh_flags bits
                                    in the OS-specific ranges for those fields, and a
                                    link editor processing this section does not 
                                    recognize those values, then the link editor should
                                    reject the object file containing this section with
                                    an error.
           SHF_GROUP         0x200  the section is a member (perhaps the only one) of a
                                    section group. The section must be referenced by a
                                    section of type SHT_GROUP. The SHF_GROUP flag may
                                    be set only for sections contained in relocatable
                                    objects (objects with the ELF header e_type member
                                    set to ET_REL).
           SHF_TLS           0x400  the section holds Thread Local Storage, meaning that
                                    each separate execution flow has its own distinct
                                    instance of this data
           SHF_COMPRESSED    0x800  identifies a section containing compressed data.
	                            SHF_COMPRESSED applies only to non-allocable sections
                                    and cannot be used in conjunction with SHF_ALLOC.
	                            In addition SHF_COMPRESSED cannot be applied to
                                    sections of type SHT_NOBITS.
                                    All relocations to a compressed section specify
                                    offsets to the uncompressed section data. It is
                                    therefore necessary to decompress the section data
                                    before relocations can be applied. Each decompressed
                                    section specifies the algorithm independently. It
                                    is permissible for different sections in a given
                                    ELF object to employ different compression 
                                    algorithms. 
                                    Compressed sections begin with a compression header
                                    structure that identifies the compression algorithm.
