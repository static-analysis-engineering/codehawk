(** [disassemble_instruction ch base firstbyte] returns the opcode that starts
    with [firstbyte] and whose potential continuation can be obtained from the
    inputstream [ch]. The [base] argument is provided to enable the compuatation
    of an absolute target address for a relative jump or call, that is,

    [absolute_address = base + position]

    so [base] should be the base of the code section being disassembled, not
    necessarily the code base, if there are multiple code sections.
