(* variable comparator is used to rank the variables to be rewritten; the variable
   with highest rank gets rewritten. I.e. the objective is to minimize the total
   rank of the expression. E.g. with constraint x + y + z = 0 and x < y < z the
   expression z gets rewritten by -(x+y), but x or y do not get rewritten, as the
   resulting expression would involve variables with higher rank *)
